***A composable data system in a Python package.***

![Source: [Voltron Data Composable Codex](https://voltrondata.com/codex)](img/layers.png)

This project uses:

1. **User interface**: [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) (Python dataframe code and/or SQL)
2. **Execution engine**: [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) (local) and [ClickHouse](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse) (remote)
3. **Data storage**: [Delta Lake](https://github.com/delta-io/delta) tables (local or cloud object storage)

You can mix and match these components as needed.

## Setup

Get up and running in 5 steps.

::: {.callout-caution}
A Python virtual environment is recommended. Use the [developer setup](#development) to create one automatically.
:::

### Installation

Install:

```bash
pip install python-analytics-accelerator
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This makes the `acc` CLI available as long as you have a Python environment with the package installed active. Type `acc` in your terminal to see available commands.
:::

### Initialize

Initialize:

```bash
acc init
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Edit the `config.py` file to the GitHub repository and PyPI package you want to analyze.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Edit the `.env` to add your GitHub token or otherwise set `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable. The token needs to have the `public_repo` read scope.

You can use `gh auth token` to print your GitHub token if you have the GitHub CLI installed. For example:

```bash
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=\"$(gh auth token)\"" > .env
```
:::

### Ingest

Ingest from external sources:

```bash
acc ingest
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This creates data in `datalake/_raw`.
:::

### ETL

Run ETL:

```bash
acc etl
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This creates Delta Lake tables in `datalake/`.
:::

### Dashboard

Open dashboard:

```bash
acc dashboard
```

::: {.callout-tip}
This creates a `dashboard.py` file that you can customize.
:::

## Development

Clone and change into the repository:

```bash
gh repo clone lostmygithubaccount/python-analytics-accelerator
cd python-analytics-accelerator
```

[Install `just`](https://github.com/casey/just) and then:

```bash
just setup
```

Format your code:

```bash
just fmt
```
