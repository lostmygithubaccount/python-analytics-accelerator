# Python analytics accelerator

***A composable data system in a Python package.***

![layers](img/layers.png)

This project uses:

1. **User interface**: Ibis (Python dataframe code and/or SQL)
2. **Execution engine**: DuckDB (local) and ClickHouse (remote)
3. **Data storage**: Delta Lake tables (local and/or cloud storage)

You can mix and match these components as needed.

> [!CAUTION]
> This accelerator is not production-ready, but could be a good starting point. For now it is primarily intended as an educational resource.

## setup

Get up and running in 5 steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> A Python virtual environment is recommended.

### 1. install

Install:

```bash
pip install python-analytics-accelerator
```

> [!TIP]
> This makes the `acc` CLI available as long as you have a Python environment with the package installed active. Type `acc` in your terminal to see available commands.

### 2. initialize

Initialize:

```bash
acc init
```

> [!TIP]
> Edit the `config.py` file to the GitHub repository and PyPI package you want to analyze.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Edit the `.env` to add your GitHub token or otherwise set `GITHUB_TOKEN` as an environment variable. The token needs to have the `public_repo` read scope.
>
> You can use `gh auth token` to print your GitHub token if you have the GitHub CLI installed. For example:
> 
> ```bash
> echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=\"$(gh auth token)\"" > .env
> ```

### 3. ingest

Ingest from external sources:

```bash
acc ingest
```

### 4. run data DAG

Run data DAG:

```bash
acc run
```

### 5. dashboard

Open dashboard:

```bash
acc dashboard
```

> [!TIP]
> This creates a `metrics.py` file that you can customize.

## development

```bash
gh repo clone lostmygithubaccount/python-analytics-accelerator
cd python-analytics-accelerator
```
