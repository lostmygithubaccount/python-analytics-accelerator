# Python analytics accelerator

***A composable data system in a Python package.***

![layers](img/layers.png)

This project uses:

1. **User interface**: Ibis (Python dataframe code and/or SQL)
2. **Execution engine**: DuckDB (local) and ClickHouse (remote)
3. **Data storage**: Delta Lake tables (local and/or cloud storage)

You can mix and match these components as needed.

> [!CAUTION]
> This accelerator is not necessarily production-ready, but might be a good starting point. For now, it is primarily intended as an educational resource.

## setup

Get up and running in 5 steps.

### install

> [!TIP]
> This makes the `acc` CLI available as long as you have a Python environment with the package installed active. Type `acc` in your terminal to see available commands.

### initialize

Initialize:

```bash
acc init
```

> [!TIP]
> Edit the `config.py` file to the GitHub repository and PyPI package you want to analyze.

> [!IMPORTANT]
